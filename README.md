# Image enhancement using Python

We aim to perform the following enhancements on Black-White images :
 - Denoising (Wiener filter, etc.)
 - Sharpening
 - Contrast adjustment
 - Histogram equalization to adjust grayscale
 - Correcting non-uniform illumination

etc. and then subsequently colorize using neural networks.
